# ePortfolio
I created this portfolio as the capstone for my Computer Science program. It uses several programs that I have made through school and through my free time to demonstrate the skills I have developed and the many different ways I have implemented these skills over time. This portfolio was created with the intention of showing what I can do to potential future employers, and to show that I am ready to graduate from my program.
## Farkle
This folder holds the files relevant to my Farkle programs. You will find the original C++ version, the Python enhancement, and the rules text file for the project.
## Pokemon Battler
This folder contains the Pokemon Battler original version and the upgraded version. Normally I would use something like V1 and V2 in the names, but I chose to stick to normal naming conventions, while also ensuring that the two cannot be confused.
## Animal Shelter
This folder contains my original Python file as well as the enhancement Javascript file. These are both very simple programs, but the undertaking to reach the Javascript version was great.
## Documents
I have also included a written narrative detailing each enhancement process, and a professional self assessment of my skills that I have developed to this point.
